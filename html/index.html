  <h3>About me</h3>
  <p>
    At 23 I was working a manual labor job and attempting college unfulfilled. I decided that the path I was on didn't align with my goals
    and with a giant leap of faith used a credit card with a $500 limit to start a small home service based company. Within 3 years the
    company went from $0 in revenue per year to over $400,000. I consider the experience and education I got from starting my own company
    to be priceless, and as of January 2019 I sold the company giving myself a tremendous amount of freedom.
    I believe irreverence is a virtue and that there are many paths to accomplishing goals so long as you keep an open mind and are willing
    to work like a mercenary.
